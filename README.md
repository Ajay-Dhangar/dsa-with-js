# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Basic Course

Where to start? At the beginning, of course! This course is designed to help you understand the basics of data structures and algorithms, how they work, and how to implement them in JavaScript. This course is not designed to teach you JavaScript, but rather to show you how to apply your existing JavaScript knowledge to solve problems.

## What are data structures and algorithms?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. Algorithms are a set of instructions to follow in order to solve a problem.

## Why is it important to know data structures and algorithms?

Data structures and algorithms are patterns that you can use to solve common problems. They are not language specific, but you can implement them in any language. They are the patterns you will use to write clean and efficient code.
